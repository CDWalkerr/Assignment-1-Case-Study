## Wealthsimples Overview and Origin
Wealthsimple, a Canadian FinTech company that has become a household name started from humble beginnings and exploded into the easy-to-use trading, tax, investment, and crypto platform today. The story starts in September of 2014. Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler left their Silicon Valley-based startup jobs to work on their new project called Wealthsimple in Toronto.

The idea for Wealthsimple was born from a very simple concept, sharing investing tips and tricks. More specifically, it was born from one of Katchen's spreadsheets that listed multiple trading techniques and practices that he shared with his close family and friends. This spreadsheet was aimed at trying to tackle the scary world on the financial markets and making it easy for anyone to invest and find success. Although this spreadsheet proved to be useful, it did not reach as many people as Katchen had hoped. This sparked an idea, creating an easier way to give anyone the financial tools for

## Wealthsimples Business Activities

As previously stated, Wealthsimple is in the wealth management and investment management industry. Although many large institutional banks and investment firms are also in this industry, they usually have a high barrier of entry and like to manage a small number of people with larger portfolios. This greatly reduces the number of customers that can participate in this sector. Wealthsimple aims to fix this solution through a multitude of ways. Mainly through applying the use of technology to improve overall efficiency and usablility in their apps. Setting up an account, depositing funds and creating a portfolio with a robo advisor or your own account is simplified. User-friendly UI and being able to do the whole process online makes it possible for anyone to set up an account in under an hour. 

Wealthsimple's simplicity makes it an attractive product for an individual who is looking to expose themselves to investing but is looking for that first step. Their all-in-one platform make it easy to start one account have access to robotrading, personal trading, investment advisors and your taxes. The all-in-one aspect eliminates any complications from trying to coordinate all of these areas through different companies. This primarily attracts a 
***[younger demographic](https://www.salesforce.com/ca/customer-success-stories/wealthsimple/)***
who may not have a ton of cash to invest but still want to get involved. As previously stated, being a Canadian company, Wealthsimple has a large market share in the Canadian market. This larger demographic is catered to by offering zero-commission stock trading for all Canadian companies. This would be harder for other trading platforms outside Canada to compete, simply due to Wealthsimple being started out of Toronto as a Canadian company. Another advantage that they have was merging with Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc. Who already has a large 
***[organizational structure](https://www.powercorporation.com/en/companies/organization-chart/)***
of more traditional, non-tech, investment and wealth management companies. This allows for Wealthsimple to apply new and emerging finance techniques to their platform and robo traders if it is being used by another one of the subsidiaries. 

Although the use of technology is very well applied to make sure the user experience is smooth, there are also many other applications of technology. One is the use of AI to help manage funds and make trades. Machine learning is at the forefront of trading at the financial markets and Wealthsimple is not far behind. By utilizing this technology and applying it their AI can learn different risk factors and trading patterns to give their users the best technical experience possible. Although the more an AI is applied the better is will work, the implementation is purely in the robo advisor function of Wealthsimple.

## Wealthsimples Landscape

Leading in the wealth management and financial management from a new and fresh technical standpoint for a younger demographic is a strong position for any company. Wealthsimple has had significant growth and overall run a good business in this sector. However, this does not mean that Wealthsimple is left without competitors. Robotrading and investment advisors have always been around for over 25 years for more experience and well trained individuals. The largest banks and used many computers to predict the outcomes of stock prices for years to only give themselves an edge. Over the last 10-15 years, as this tehnology becomes more through the modern day internet, others have attempted to capitalize as well. 

One of the main competitors that Wealthsimple has is Quuest Trade. Quest Trade is another Toronto-based firm that offers many of the same services as Wealthsimple. Quest trade is a larger firm with over 
***[$30 billion AUM,](https://www.questrade.com/about-us/who-we-are)***
double that of Wealthsimples. Although similar, Quest Trade does have certain differences when compared to Wealthsimple. For instance, 
***[Wealthsimple has a crypto trading platform while Quest Trade allows for U.S. dollar accounts.](https://www.greedyrates.ca/blog/wealthsimple-trade-vs-questrade/)***
Another key difference is Wealthsimples more user friendly UI vs Quest Trades more advanced look seperates these 2 companies from each other. While these differences are notable, these two companies compete when attracting customers.

Another competitor that Wealthsimple will have to start monitoring is Nest Wealth. 
***[Another Toronto based firm focusing on robo investing.](https://www.wealthrocket.com/investing/nest-wealth-review/)***
This eliminates having the freedom to create your own investing account to make decisions with or to buy crypto but it also allows for a new perspective on simplicity as well. This simplicity focuses on reduced fees and a more dynamic fee structure. Nest Wealth's small size of 50-200 employees allows for them to focus on efficiency and rival Wealthsimples robo trading feature. 

Lastly, other competitors are more traditional Canadian banks such as RBC, BMO, CIBC and many more, creating trading platforms for their customers to use. Usually, these types of trading platorms are slightly more sophisticated in terms of stock market trading but with 
***[lack other features such as robotraders and crypto options.](https://milliondollarjourney.com/wealthsimple-vs-td.htm)*** 
These options are also fee heavy as the banks only justify creating these platforms if it will turn a profit and are not looking to seize market share. These competitors are less of a threat to Wealthsimple as a whole.

## Wealthsimples Impacts

Although Wealthsimple faces strong competition, they are by no means falling behind. Many wealth management and financial management companies go by one overall metric to state their size which is Assets under management (AUM). Since 2014, Wealthsimple has seen an exponential growth in their AUM. Since inception, there has been an average of over 400% increase in AUM for Wealthsimple. Another metric that is used is the number of users on the platform. Although each business has a different target number of users, Wealthsimple and its largest competitors want more users (within reason). The number of Wealthsimples users has also had a significant growth of over 1.5 million since inception. 

Although these numbers of strong, they also compare well against industry competitors as well. Quest trade has a higher AUM than Wealthsimple at $20 billion but have been around for over twice as long and as a company. Nest Wealth, like Wealthsimple, also would have a desire to increase the number of users as much as possible. This is because of the slim profit margins they make per user. Wealthsimple vastly exceeds Nest Wealth

## Reccomendations for Wealthsimple

After taking an internal and external look at Wealthsimple, it is hard to critique. This company has seen explosive growth from humble beginnings and continues to grow to this day. However, there are a few key areas that can be improved upon. 

First, Wealthsimple has always focused on usablility and user-friendliness. However, this has also weighed them down in other aspects. Traders looking to get their hands on options, shorting and other more advanced trading tools are out of luck when using Wealthsimple. If Wealthsimple could add these features without complicating the current experience they could expand their user base. Adding a Trading+ tab in a similar way to how the crypto tab as added is the answer. This Trading+ tab would fit in with the robo investing, crypto and tax features and allow for users to dive a little depper if they desire. Setting up this feature will cost money for Wealthsimple so a new fee structure specifically within the Trading+ function could be implemented to cover those costs. This overall keeps the user friendly aspect and allows for more advanced functionality.

The next recommendation would be to further push the AI and share more with customers on any predictions the robo advisors make and publish it to their newsletter. Wealthsimple usually carries out news letter covering investing tips or investing news. By investing in more AI capability to run a 'mock' portfolio and provide updates through a newsletter will help in various ways. It will overall advertise the customers to the robo advisor who may have only been using the trading, crypto or tax platforms beforehand. Interest and curiosity can be directly captured through the newsletter and can increase the use of robotraders. This recommendation also allows for further AI training will will not only be interesting to publicly document over time, but will also make the AI better as trading overall.

These reccomendation will overall make Wealthsimple into an even stronger company and will allow them to keep growing as a company.
